      <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is SEO?</h2><br>

      <p style="font-family: Lucida Bright, serif" > Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left;">Guidlines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page </h2><br>

      <p style="font-family: Lucida Bright, serif"> Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results. The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed. The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.) Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly. PPC ads are typically placed at the top of the search results (three or four results, though sometimes Google omits the top ads) and in a column to the right of the main search results. </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left;">How SEO Affects Business? </h2><br>

      <p style="font-family: Lucida Bright, serif"> If you are a business, there are some very real and specific benefits to having a consistent, ongoing search engine optimization strategy. For the first time in the history of marketing, users are offering up their actual intent through the words that they type into search engines. And more than ever before,you can measure the results of your SEO efforts as a marketing channel. While search engines don't charge you for listing your web pages, planning and implementing SEO in your organization is certainly not free. You'll need to spend the time, money, and resources…to do this the right way. The good news is that this can help you obtain a tremendous marketing reach, attract more targeted visitors, and measure the impact of your efforts in terms of a return on your investment. More and more content appears on the web every second of every day. And your customers need search engines to help make sense of it all. In fact, the bigger the web gets, the more search engine usage continues to grow. People search to find answers to their questions. </p>
